  - question: What are the key reasons for using healthcare APIs?
    answer: Application programming interfaces help to ensure the connection between
      different healthcare apps and systems and make them seamlessly
      interoperate and exchange data. Thanks to them, your applications, EHR
      systems, and other sources of data (such as, for example, drug databases)
      can be unified and used as a single source of reliable information.
  - question: How much does it cost to use medical APIs?
    answer: The prices set by different healthcare API vendors greatly vary and may
      be calculated based on different models. Some providers use a
      transaction-based model where they set rates per call. Some other models
      presuppose different pricing for different sets of features. There is also
      an option to pay an annual fee for access to the API and related services.
      That's why you always need to find out the exact terms of each vendor
      before making your choice. By the way, sometimes there is a free trial
      period that can help you to get familiarized with a product.

Despite the huge progress made in the development of software solutions for the healthcare industry over recent years, there is still a lot of work to do. In 2022, the global digital health market size [reached](https://www.statista.com/topics/2409/digital-health/#topicOverview) $330 billion, and investments in this market are expected to grow. According to [analysts](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-digital-health-market), by 2030, this figure may hit the mark of $809.2 billion. The digital transformation is going on. But is it as smooth as it is expected to be? Unfortunately, there are still a lot of issues related to a lack of data sharing between healthcare providers, format inconsistency (a lot of clinics in the US rely on faxes even today), and low interoperability of the used solutions. And here is when (and why) healthcare APIs enter the game.

## Healthcare API: Basic info

Before we proceed to the discussion of the top healthcare APIs and healthcare API vendors, it will be useful to make sure that you clearly understand what such kind of API is and what tasks it can help to solve.

In general, the abbreviation "API" stands for **Application Programming Interface**, which ensures a way of communication between two or more software programs. Today APIs are widely used in the software development industry to facilitate the integration of solutions with different external services, streamline data transfer, and provide users with access to additional functionality.

Healthcare APIs make it possible for information systems to interact and exchange data. In other words, they can be defined as sets of standards or protocols that are responsible for transferring and communicating medical data from one system or application to another. Their use also leads to continuously increasing interoperability.

The role of an API in healthcare can be better explained with the help of a real-life example. Thanks to the use of an API, a healthcare provider can get instant access to a system that is also used by insurance companies and see what options the patient's insurance coverage presupposes, and what procedures or medication can be provided to a person within the chosen insurance program. At the same time, insurance companies can get instant confirmation of their funds allocation.

## What are the benefits of using a medical API?

As you can see from the offered example, the use of APIs can bring a range of benefits to all the participants in the healthcare industry, including medical centers, hospitals, healthcare authorities, insurance companies, and patients.

## How to choose the right healthcare API for your solution?

Of course, it may be rather confusing to quickly make a decision when there is such a huge choice of available solutions. To make this process easier for you, we've prepared a list of tips.

![How to choose medical API - Checklist](Checklist.png)

1. **Analyze the needs of your app.** Define the exact tasks that you want to solve with your API. For example, if you are not going to receive and process any payments via your app, such APIs as Stripe and Paypal shouldn't be taken into consideration.

2. **Check the security and reliability of the API.** Top healthcare API vendors take care of their reputation and do their best to provide high-quality solutions. Before making a final decision, you can do your own research on the internet.You can read overviews and comments left by developers and healthcare organizations that have already integrated the APIs that you want to use in your software products.

3. **Find out whether the provider supports the offered APIs.** When the vendor has good documentation and continuously supports the API, its integration as well as further app modernizations will be seamless for you.

4. **Pay attention to the financial terms.** While some APIs are free to use, some others are provided on a paid base. That's why we recommend you carefully read the agreement where all the terms should be clearly stated.

5. **Be careful with open-source APIs.** On the one hand, such APIs have a lot of benefits. Developers can change the code in accordance with the needs of your project which provides a lot of flexibility. But on the other hand, there are some pitfalls. And some of them are related to the protection of data. That's why for healthcare apps, it is better to rely on proprietary APIs that are well-supported and maintained by vendors.

When you work with a software development team, you can always discuss the choice of a medical API with your developers. While you will deeper analyze the provided functionality, IT specialists will pay more attention to the tech aspects. For example, at Anadea, we are always open to such discussions and are ready to help our customers to make the right choice.

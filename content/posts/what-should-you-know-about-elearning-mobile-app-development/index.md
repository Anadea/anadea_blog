## Native or cross-platform e-learning mobile app?

One of the main tech-related decisions that you will need to make is whether your app will be native or cross-platform.

Native apps are developed specifically for a single platform, either iOS or Android. Cross-platform apps are built with the help of frameworks that allow the same codebase to be deployed on multiple platforms.

It is impossible to say which approach to app development is better as both of them have pluses and minuses. Your decision should be based on the needs and peculiarities of your project.

</table>

Given the peculiarities of both types of mobile software, it is sensible to choose each of them in the following situations.

Native app development should be chosen when:

* You have a complex app and its performance is a critical factor;
* To provide the required functionality, you need to have full access to platform-specific features;
* You want to ensure the best possible user experience for each platform.

You should consider cross-platform app development when:

* You need to release your app for several platforms as quickly as possible;
* The functionality of your application is rather straightforward and it doesn’t heavily rely on platform-specific features;
* Consistency across platforms is crucial;
* You have a limited budget.

## How to find developers who will build an e-learning mobile application?

If a company doesn’t have in-house developers and doesn’t want to hire such specialists, the only possible solution will be to work with external programmers. There are two models that any business can opt for to cooperate with freelancers or with an e-learning mobile app development company.

These two variants have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, it can be easier to hire freelancers. Moreover, their services can be cheaper than those of a professional agency. Nevertheless, when it comes to better protection of your rights and guarantee of a high-quality final product, cooperation with an eLearning mobile app development company will be a better choice.

We recommend you work with freelancers when you have small tasks that should be done as quickly as possible. For serious projects, such as educational mobile app development, it will be more sensible to find a reliable vendor likeAnadea.

To do it, you can rely on professional platforms. For example, you can use Clutch or GoodFirms. There you can check the reviews and ratings, as well as find a lot of useful information about the expertise of the development agency, the technologies that its specialists work with, etc.

What factors should you pay attention to?

* Experience of the team;
* Its expertise in e-learning mobile app development and its portfolio;
* Reviews and rating;
* Available engagement models and terms of cooperation.

The question of development costs is also a very important one. Nevertheless, as we have already mentioned, the necessary amount for your project realization will depend on your requirements. That’s why before deciding on your possible cooperation with a firm, you should ask the team to analyze your project idea and provide you with an estimate.

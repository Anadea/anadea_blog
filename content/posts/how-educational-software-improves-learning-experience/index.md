It’s important to say from the start that in today’s world there are 2 types of schools - traditional schools and online schools. Depending on what type your school belongs to, there will be different answers to the question “How to create educational software for schools”. An <a href="https://anadea.info/solutions/e-learning-software-development" target="_blank">educational software development company</a>, we will cover them both.

## For traditional schools
__School management system software__<br />
Modern schools tend to have a solid technical foundation for a full school ecosystem. You probably ask yourself “what scope of processes should a School Management System Software cover?” The answer is that it can ease routine for all participants - from school administration to students and parents. A lot of modules can be included in it, from managing school staff and procurement to reporting to governmental institutions, bookkeeping, and developing curricula. With its help, you can see how your school is doing as an organization, get insights on teachers’ load and efficiency, evaluate students’ performance and progress, the state of the training base, and much much more.

To define the necessary scope for School Management System Software development, it’s a good idea to conduct a <a href="https://anadea.info/blog/how-to-turn-your-project-into-fantastic-with-discovery-phase-in-software-development" target="_blank">discovery phase</a> with a professional BA.
It’s probably that in the basic complectation you’ll need these modules:

* Student Management
* Learning Management
* Staff Management
* Facility Management
* Financial Management

Let’s look at the time and cost and team composition to build an MVP version of such a system. The team will consist of:

* Business analyst
* UI/UX designer
* Front-end engineer
* Back-end engineer
* QA specialist

The approximate time for development will be about 5-7 months, and the price will start from $128K.

__Education administration software__<br />
The core occupation of the school is teaching students. Education administration software is a lighter version of School Management Software, it helps to automate administrative processes in educational institutions starting from scheduling and classroom administration, finishing with the supervision of an educational process and students’ performance.

The approximate time for development will be about 3 months, and the price will start from $65K with the same team composition.

__A specific module__<br />
Sometimes there’s no need to develop a solution from the ground up. In case you need some functionality to add to the existing solution, you can build some specific module and integrate it with your system. It will cost you about $15-20K and take approximately 1,5-2 months.

## Other types of solutions in education software

## Instead of conclusions
Typically, developing educational software requires a lot of integrations with various third-party services, as often, there’s no need to build some functionality from scratch. Secondly, it requires compliance with education standards like SCORM, xAPI, LTI and others. Don’t forget about GDPR and Accessibility.

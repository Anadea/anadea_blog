## How to implement AI in your business: 8 essential steps

Every company is unique. This means that the one-size-fits-all approach won’t be the best choice. Each case should be viewed individually. Nevertheless, some key steps can become the basis of your AI implementation plan.

That’s why if you are considering different options on how to implement AI in business, we strongly recommend you review the following to-do list.

### Step 1. Identify your business needs and goals

You should start by identifying the pain areas where AI can be used to address key challenges or inefficiencies. Just a small hint from us. Very often such areas are customer service, marketing, operations, and supply chain management.

When you have found the problems that should be solved in the first turn, you need to set clear objectives. You need to answer the following question “What should AI do for me?”. The possible goals include such points as cost reduction, revenue increase, or customer experience enhancement.

At this step of artificial intelligence implementation, you also need to find out how AI will impact your processes, activities, and teams in general.

### Step 2. Find the most relevant data sources and/or collect your own data

AI models rely on data. When you already have an understanding of the types of solutions that you will need to introduce, you should assess if your business has sufficient quality data to train models. If not, you should focus on building a data collection first. For your solutions, you may need to use data from your CRM systems or financial data, or it may be sensible to include external sources as well. For example, you can utilize data from social media or news feeds.

Make sure that you have proper systems in place to collect, store, and organize data. In the framework of artificial intelligence implementation, it will be also necessary to invest in databases. Many businesses also choose cloud storage for these purposes.

It’s also critical to regularly clean and refine your data. High-quality, structured, and relevant data is a key to the efficient work of AI models.

### Step 3. Choose the right AI solutions that will fully meet your requirements

Here, you have two options to choose from. You can either rely on off-the-shelf products (like CRM AI tools or chatbots) or you can build your own custom system. Though the first variant usually requires smaller investments, it has a row of limitations, when it comes to scalability, integrations, and customization.

Custom development offers much more freedom and flexibility. You can equip your system with any tools and technologies. It means that it will be fully tailored to the specificity of your business. In one of our previously published blog posts, we described the process of [AI software development](https://anadea.info/blog/how-to-create-ai-software). If you want to learn more about it or need help from professional developers, at Anadea, we will be always ready to help you.

### Step 4. Develop an effective strategy for artificial intelligence implementation

Strategic planning is a must. It should contain the main answers to all the questions on how to incorporate AI into your business.

You need to have a clear AI implementation roadmap. It should outline key milestones, timelines, and expected outcomes.

We also always recommend our customers break down the process into manageable phases and start with small pilot projects before full deployment. This will facilitate all the tasks for you and let avoid a lot of serious financial risks.

### Step 5. Build the required IT infrastructure

Make sure that your existing infrastructure, including servers, cloud platforms, and databases can support AI workloads and is ready for artificial intelligence implementation.

This point is especially relevant for solutions-powered ML models or large datasets.

### Step 6. Make sure that you have relevant AI expertise

Your “How to implement AI in business” plan should include not only efforts aimed at choosing and introducing tech solutions but also at upskilling your team.

If your employees have never worked with artificial intelligence before, they may have a lot of worries and concerns. It will be a good idea to provide AI and data literacy training to your staff. It will help your team members to effectively collaborate with AI systems.

It can be also sensible to hire AI experts, such as data scientists, AI engineers, or machine learning developers.

### Step 7. Integrate AI into your processes

AI should be seamlessly connected with your existing software, workflows, and systems. AI implementation should be organized in such a way that this technology will augment rather than disrupt current processes.

You may need to redesign certain business processes to accommodate new solutions, especially if these solutions are supposed to optimize or automate parts of them.

### Step 8. Continuously monitor, evaluate, and enhance your solutions

To understand whether you are on the right way, use key performance indicators. KPIs will help to measure such parameters as productivity, costs, or customer satisfaction. Based on the results of the evaluation, you can make decisions on the necessity to change something in your solutions.

AI systems need regular monitoring and updates. Algorithms might need retraining, especially when you get new data. You also should refine AI models based on performance and feedback.

## AI cost estimation: What to take into account?

While considering AI implementation, you also should think about the cost of such a project. It is very important to make estimates as precise as possible. Otherwise, the risk of running out of budget will be too high.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to name any accurate figure for your AI implementation initiative without studying your requirements, needs, and expectations. Such projects can be too different for different companies. This explains why you can’t take somebody else’s estimates as a benchmark.

Costs of the basic model developments can start at $5,000. At the same time, for the creation of some advanced systems with complex functionality, you may need to pay $500,000 or even more. Such figures do not look very helpful, right?

That’s why it will be more sensible to consider the range of factors and parameters that will influence the cost of AI implementation at your organization.

### Factors that impact the costs of artificial intelligence implementation

* Necessary hardware (like GPUs and ASICs);
* Data-related costs, including costs of data collection, preparation and cleaning (here, it is very important to bear in mind that a type of data will have a huge impact. For example, those models that operate with images will be much more expensive than those that provide only textual outputs);
* Software development costs or licensing fees;
* Labor costs (training for existing staff and new hiring);
* Cybersecurity measures;
* AI integration costs;
* Compliance measures.

## Final word

As you can see AI implementation projects can require rather significant investments. Nevertheless, with a clear strategy, high-quality data, and the right expertise, such initiatives can bring a lot of new opportunities and benefits to businesses.

Nevertheless, to enjoy all the possible advantages, you need to make sure that your team has the knowledge and skills required to introduce AI to your business processes.

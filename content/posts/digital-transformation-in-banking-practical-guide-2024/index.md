### Challenge 3. Resistance to change

Digital transformation often requires a shift in company culture. However, employees (and often even C-level managers) may resist changes.

**How to address it**: It will be sensible to introduce a structured change management program to support employees throughout the transformation. This program may include workshops, training, and educational materials.

### Challenge 4. Legacy system and infrastructure

Many banks still rely on legacy systems that are difficult to integrate with new digital technologies.

**How to address it**: Modernization of the entire ecosystem can be a very time-consuming and expensive project. You can use a phased approach to upgrade legacy systems, starting with the most critical areas. In many cases, it can be a good idea to migrate systems to cloud platforms. This will offer scalability and flexibility for further transformation. To connect new technologies with your existing systems, you can use APIs. They will facilitate data exchange without overhauling the entire infrastructure.

### Challenge 5. Personalization without compromising privacy

Banks aim to provide personalized services by leveraging customer data. Nevertheless, it can be challenging to balance personalization with privacy.

**How to address it**: You should adopt privacy-first strategies. For example, you need to use anonymized data and ensure that personalization does not compromise customer confidentiality. It is also required to openly explain to customers how their data will be used to enhance services.

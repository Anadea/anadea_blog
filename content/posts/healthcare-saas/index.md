questionary:
  - question: How much does it cost to build a healthcare SaaS solution?
    answer: The budgets required for such projects may seriously vary. It happens
      because it is necessary to take into account a lot of factors while
      calculating the development costs. Typically they can vary from $50K to
      $500K. This huge difference is explained by the fact that all projects are
      not the same, they have different tech stacks, integrations, and levels of
      complexity. Moreover, the size of the team, the set timelines, and the
      rates of your developers also will have an impact.
  - question: How long does it take to develop a SaaS for healthcare?
    answer: When a development team needs to build a SaaS product, it may take from
      a couple of months to a couple of years. Precise timelines are usually
      discussed with developers at the project planning stage.

Going to the cloud is one of the top tech trends that we can observe across many industries, including healthcare, in recent years. Around [84% of healthcare organizations worldwide ](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/healthcare-cloud-computing-market)are already using cloud services.

SaaS (Software as a Service) is the most popular software delivery model in the market. It accounts for around [61% of the healthcare cloud-based software market share](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-healthcare-cloud-computing-market-industry), and this figure clearly demonstrates its dominance over IaaS and PaaS models.

In our article, we are going to talk about the peculiarities of SaaS in healthcare and explain the benefits of this model for both patients and healthcare providers.

##  What Is Healthcare SaaS?

SaaS in healthcare refers to cloud-based software solutions that are delivered over the internet and accessed via a web browser. It means that users do not need to download and further install such apps on their smartphones, tablets, laptops, or PCs. They can get access to such applications and the provided data from any device, from any location, and at any time.

Such solutions are created in accordance with the needs of hospitals, medical centers, and healthcare institutions and may cover aspects like billing, managing patient records, analytics, and many others. They greatly facilitate data exchange and collaboration between different healthcare providers, which is vital for ensuring high-quality medical services.

SaaS in healthcare is already a widely applied model. But what is even more important is that this market is continuously expanding. Analysts are quite optimistic about the future of this sector.

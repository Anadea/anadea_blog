According to the PwC survey, 75% of executives think that AI agents will change the workplace more significantly than the wide adoption of the internet did. Meanwhile, 88% of companies plan to increase their AI-related budgets in 2025 due to agentic AI. These statistics reflect a growing belief in the power of agentic AI to optimize and simplify the way we work and solve problems.

From customer support chatbots to data analysis tools, AI agents can bring efficiency to many business processes and aspects, including customer support, data search, analytics, and many others. Moreover, they help significantly reduce the dependency on human input.

This guide offers a practical approach to building such solutions. Based on our solid expertise in AI software development, we will explain this topic in simple terms. That’s why, if you are just starting your journey with artificial intelligence, our article will help you better understand the basics.

What Is an Agent in AI?

An AI agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous software system that can perceive its environment, process data, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

Such systems work based on a combination of inputs, including data received from users, sensors, or other systems, as well as algorithms and decision-making rules. Additionally, they are powered by an output mechanism that enables them to interact with users and the environment.

How AI Agents Can Be Used

Already today, AI agents have found their use across industries. According to PwC’s AI Agent Survey, as of May 2025, 57% of companies have already implemented AI agents for customer support or are planning to do so within the next six months. Sales and marketing are the second most common applications of such solutions, while IT and cybersecurity are in third place.





Real-life Examples of AI Agents

Today, a lot of prominent companies have already successfully launched their AI agents.

Customer support. Zendesk AI agents are powered by natural language understanding and action capabilities. They can handle 80%+ of customer interactions without human participation. AI agents detect customer intent and sentiment to craft responses in a human-like manner. Some of the businesses that implemented Zendesk AI agents in their processes report significant outcomes, like a 66% automation rate, up to 50% reduction in ticket volumes, and multi-hundred-thousand-dollar savings per year.

Coding assistants. GitHub Copilot provides real-time code completions, from single lines to entire functions or boilerplate. Additionally, it can offer review suggestions to improve your codebase. In a controlled experiment, developers using GitHub Copilot completed coding tasks 55% faster than those without it. 87% of surveyed users said Copilot helped preserve mental energy during repetitive tasks. 73% noted Copilot helped them maintain focus and stay in the flow.

Data analysis and reporting. Such agents can pull data, analyze trends, and generate reports. Power BI Copilot is one of the examples. Even non-technical users without specific knowledge can build reports, generate insights, and explore data through prompts in natural language. Power BI Copilot integrates smoothly with services like Azure Data Factory, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Teams.

The data that comes from PwC’s survey shows that 66% of respondents cited increased productivity as the main advantage of using AI agents. Cost savings (57%), faster decision-making (55%), and improved customer experience (54%) are among other commonly mentioned benefits.

AI Agent App vs Chatbot vs LLM Wrapper

Sometimes AI agents are compared to chatbots and LLM wrappers. All of them can understand and respond to natural language, as well as fulfill some of the tasks that previously couldn’t be performed without human participation.

Nevertheless, these are different types of solutions. While AI agents can demonstrate autonomous or semi-autonomous behavior, chatbots are just conversational interfaces that can simulate a natural dialogue. At the same time, LLM wrappers are apps that allow users to interact with large language models via a visual interface, but they can’t function independently.

You can find a more detailed comparison in the table below.

  - question: Who can build a medical appointment app for me?
    answer: If you are looking for external specialists, you always have several
      options. You can either hire freelancers or work with a professional
      software development company like Anadea. Both options have their own
      pluses. However, if you are looking for stable long-term cooperation, the
      variant of establishing cooperation with a firm will be more appropriate
      in your case.
  - question: What are the benefits of a doctor scheduling app?
    answer: As this software allows patients to book appointments online, it can
      greatly streamline and facilitate all the related tasks. People do not
      need to spend their time trying to reach administrators of a medical
      center via phone. They can make appointments just in a few minutes at any
      time of the day. Such solutions can not only help to reduce the required
      time but also can minimize the risks of mistakes caused by human factors.
      With the introduction of these tools, the workload for administrators will
      be lower, while the patient experience will be significantly enhanced.

## Our experience in building solutions for the healthcare industry

At Anadea, we work with companies that work in different spheres, but healthcare is one of the domains that we focus on.

In our portfolio, there is a row of solutions built for this industry, including <a href="https://anadea.info/projects/gogoof" target="_blank">**Gogoof**</a>, which is an online doctor appointment booking system. It is a web-based SaaS product for the mental health sector. With this app, therapists can schedule appointments, create custom plans for individual patients or groups, and monitor their progress. Patients also get access to the portal, can connect with professionals, view their treatment plans, and track their progress. The core feature is a calendar. It shows appointments and treatment programs, and it is absolutely simple to reschedule the planned meetings.

The platform has a wide range of tools, including but not limited to patient records management features, visit management functionality, and a staff calendar.

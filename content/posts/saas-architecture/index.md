  - question: What are SaaS architecture best practices?
    answer: >-
      There is no universal solution for creating a successful SaaS solution.
      Each case should be viewed individually but based on our experience, we
      can share some key recommendations with you. Below you can find the points
      that you need to take into account if you want to create a SaaS platform:
              <ul>
                  <li>Provide customization and personalization options</li>
                  <li>Pay attention to the security of sensitive users’ data</li>
                  <li>Ensure scalability</li>
                  <li>Offer flexible payment plans</li>
                  <li>Track the performance of your solution on a regular basis and timely update it</li>
                  <li>Try to minimize any possible downtime</li>
                  <li>Ensure regulatory compliance</li>
              </ul>
  - question: Which SaaS architecture is the best?
    answer: Unfortunately, nobody can offer you a single formula. There are no
      “one-size-fits-all” solutions. However, with a thorough preliminary
      analysis, you can find the best SaaS architecture for your project. It
      will be important to understand how you want to deliver resources to
      users, whether it will be comfortable for you to provide a separate
      database for each tenant or you want your tenant to share a common
      database and infrastructure. Everything depends on the type of solutions
      that you deliver, your approaches to managing the software as well as the
      needs and expectations of your customers.
  - question: How can I find SaaS developers for my project?
    answer: Given the current state of the software development market, there are
      different options for establishing cooperation with programmers. But in
      general, there are two options for you. First of all, you can create an
      in-house development team and hire employees who will work in your office
      or from home. But if you do not think that signing long-term contracts
      with specialists and expanding your in-house staff is a feasible idea,
      there is a second option for you. You can work with third-party
      specialists. In this case, you have a task to find a reliable company with
      good relevant experience. At Anadea, we have seasoned developers with
      excellent expertise in developing SaaS platforms of different types.
      That’s why if you choose us, we can guarantee the highest quality and
      reliability of your software products.

questionary:
  - question: How much does ML solution development cost?
    answer: The range is wide. A simple PoC to validate a hypothesis can cost 15,000
      to 30,000 dollars. A full-scale solution with a custom model,
      integrations, and MLOps infrastructure for an enterprise client reaches
      150,000 to 300,000 and beyond. The price depends on task complexity, the
      state of your data, model accuracy requirements, and whether you need to
      comply with regulations. If an agency gives you an exact number without an
      audit, they're either padding in a huge risk margin or they don't
      understand the scope of work.
  - question: How long does an ML project take from start to production?
    answer: An MVP with a basic model can launch in 2 to 3 months. More complex
      solutions with custom models, integration into existing systems, and
      compliance requirements take 6 to 12 months. The main cause of delays
      isn't development. It's data. If your data is scattered across multiple
      systems, unstructured, or low quality, preparation can take longer than
      building the model itself.
  - question: What if the model performs well on test data but poorly in production?
    answer: This is one of the most common problems, and it's rarely about the model
      quality itself. Usually, the issue is that test data doesn't reflect
      reality. User behavior changed, new patterns emerged, production data has
      a different distribution. That's why MLOps and post-deployment monitoring
      are critical. Models need regular retraining on fresh data, and you have
      to track metric drift. If an agency doesn't mention post-deployment
      support, that's a bad sign.
  - question: How can you tell if an agency is actually competent?
    answer: Look at case study depth, not award counts. Ask them to walk you through
      a project in your industry or a similar task. Get specific. What was the
      input data quality? What metrics did they achieve? What problems came up
      and how did they solve them? How is the model performing now? Pay
      attention to the discovery call. A competent team will ask lots of
      questions about your business processes, data, and constraints. If they
      propose a solution architecture right away without digging into context,
      that's a red flag.
  - question: Can we start with a small pilot first?
    answer: Yes, and it's a smart approach. A discovery phase or PoC on a limited
      budget lets you test the hypothesis, assess the real state of your data,
      and see if you work well with the team. You spend 10 to 15 percent of the
      potential full project budget but gain information that lets you make
      decisions based on facts, not slide decks. If an agency refuses to do a
      pilot and pushes for a large contract right away, think twice.

According to McKinsey, [88% of companies have already adopted AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) in at least one business function in 2025. Yet only a third managed to move beyond pilot projects. The gap between experimentation and actual production is massive. And more often than not, it comes down to who builds the solution, not the technology itself.

We've selected agencies that consistently rank at the top of Clutch and GoodFirms, have public case studies with measurable outcomes, and bring full-cycle ML development experience to the table. The list includes both niche specialized teams and enterprise-level players. Whether you need a focused [machine learning software development](https://anadea.info/services/machine-learning-software-development) partner or a large-scale engineering team, you'll find options here.

## How We Built This Ranking

As of December 2025, [Clutch lists 8,858 companies](https://clutch.co/developers/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning) in the machine learning category. Add GoodFirms, TopDevelopers, and Gartner industry ratings, and you get tens of thousands of agencies, each claiming to be a market leader. Choosing a reliable machine learning agency without clear criteria is nearly impossible. To build our list, we evaluated each company against several parameters.

1. **Public case studies with measurable results.** We looked for specifics, not generic project descriptions. How much did they cut costs? What model accuracy did they achieve? How long did it take to reach production? We paid special attention to case studies featuring the client's public name. That signals the client was satisfied enough to associate their brand with the outcome. NDA-protected cases are legitimate (unique features, market specifics, industry sensitivity), but when a portfolio consists mostly of anonymous projects, it raises questions.
2. **Technical depth.** We assessed experience with MLOps, AutoML, computer vision, and NLP, as well as proficiency in key frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). We focused on companies that don't just build models but know how to scale and maintain them in production.
3. **Experience in regulated industries.** Healthcare, finance, and insurance come with specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR. We checked whether portfolios included projects from these sectors and whether companies demonstrated a clear understanding of compliance. A technically flawless solution that doesn't meet regulations has no real value.
4. **Full-cycle development capability.** From data audits and hypothesis formation to deployment, monitoring, and ongoing support. Many teams handle PoC well but struggle when it comes to pushing a model into a live environment. We selected those with proven full-cycle project experience.
5. **Client reputation.** We analyzed ratings on Clutch and GoodFirms, read through reviews, and noted repeat contracts. Companies that clients return to usually do their job well.

The final list includes agencies that meet most of these criteria. We intentionally included companies of different sizes, from boutique teams of 30 specialists to global players with thousands of engineers. The right machine learning development agency isn't always the biggest or most expensive. It's the one whose expertise matches your specific project.

## Anadea

* Founded: 2000 
* Headquarters: Alicante, Spain 
* Team: 150+ specialists
* Rate: $25-49/hr

![](anadea-2-.png)

The company has been around since 2000, but the AI direction started developing systematically in 2019. Today it's one of the key specializations alongside private equity, fintech, healthcare, and real estate. Beyond client projects, the team builds its own products. For example, Voco is a mobile app for voice translation and AI-powered notes built on OpenAI, [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tensorway.voco&pli=1).

The machine learning agency focuses on long-term partnerships rather than one-off projects. The collaboration with [StreetEasy](https://anadea.info/projects/streeteasy), New York's leading real estate platform (now part of Zillow Group), has been going on for over 10 years. On Clutch, clients most often mention two things: the team understands business logic well rather than just coding to a spec, and knows how to handle projects with plenty of unknowns at the start.

[One of the company's recent ML projects](https://anadea.info/projects/agentic-ai-platform-private-equity) is a platform for a major European investment fund with over 10 billion euros in assets under management. Their analyst team was drowning in routine work: market monitoring consumed up to 60 hours per week, and preparing a single deal assessment could take a month. Anadea built a system of five AI agents, each handling a specific task, from automatic deal sourcing in Factiva and FactSet to company scoring across 36 parameters. The platform now processes 5,000 potential deals in a matter of hours, and the number of quality leads reaching the investment committee has tripled.

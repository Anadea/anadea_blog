You can run a business like a pro but lack creativity when it comes to finding new app ideas. Which is perfectly fine and explains why articles like this one exist.

So you see yourself as an appreneur and can’t wait to roll into the app industry. And suddenly, you stumble on the question:

## How to come up with ideas for an app?

In the ideal world, two factors must coincide: your passion for something and the demand for this something from people. For example, you enjoy rock climbing and you see that it is a popular pastime among a certain audience. A climbing guidebook app can be your solution.

However, it is not always that simple to choose what app to develop. The market is overcrowded with all kinds of apps regarding pretty much everything you can imagine. There is even a demand for clones of popular solutions. The number of Uber-like, Airbnb-like, Tinder-like, and \[insert yours]-like apps proves it.

Even considering the above, you still have a chance to introduce something new to the market, something people will need and appreciate.

### Find a problem and give a solution

This section will not take long – soon we will pass to the actual mobile app ideas. It is here to remind you how crucial it is that your app startup is not just there but there **to solve a particular problem of users**.

For instance, that very same app for rock climbers can help enthusiasts organize trips, find climbing spots near them, sort routes by difficulty, etc. in one place. Before they found the app, they had to check several resources before going for trips, and the app manages to simplify this process. A win for all!

**How to identify what the market needs?** Here is a couple of advice for you:

* Analyze popular queries using **Google Trends**. It is an easy-to-use tool that highlights the popularity of keywords of interest and simplifies your search for creative app ideas.
* Research app development agencies and their **portfolios**. Usually, portfolios feature the most successful and relevant projects. Study them well, and if some case study particularly catches your eye, think about how you would alter that app idea to improve it.
* Visit **<a href="http://data.ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">data.ai</a>**, a website synchronized with app stores that shows the demand for apps in different countries and their rating. This way, you will see what is trendy exactly to a day.

As a <a href="https://anadea.info/services/mobile-development">mobile app development company</a>, in this post we will be focusing on best app ideas for **real-life practical applications**.

## Best app ideas

Eventually, what apps to create? We prepared a comprehensive listing for you.

Mind there are apps falling into several categories at a time. We decided not to eliminate repetitions in case you are only interested in one category and do not read the whole article.

### <a href="https://anadea.info/services/machine-learning-software-development" target="_blank">AI/ML driven app</a>

<a name="parking"></a>

### Smart parking app

Finding a parking spot is a pain for many people living in cities. Thus an app for reserving one in advance can save drivers lots of time and nerves.

The working principle of a car parking app is the following: the driver enters their vehicle plate number in the app to book a spot, and once reached the spot, a sensor will read the plate and send it in the database. Then the driver will be guided to their spot via the app, and payment will be processed through the app too.

<a name="marketplace"></a>

### Marketplace app

Traditionally, a marketplace is an eCommerce platform that allows multiple sellers to sell through it. **Amazon, eBay, Etsy** are the brightest marketplace examples.

You will hardly compete with these three. To gain a competitive advantage when building a marketplace app, find a niche and develop it until you gain enough users to grow.

What eCommerce marketplace to build? Perhaps a one for handicrafts, furniture, sports gear, geek stuff, books, and more. Test the demand for every app idea you have following the advice from earlier in the article.

If none of eCommerce ideas speaks to you, consider starting an **on-demand marketplace**. An on-demand marketplace is any platform that allows professionals in any sphere to register and find clients. **Uber, Airbnb, Upwork** easily fall into this category.

<a name="shopping"></a>

### Shopping app

From horse riding ammunition to antiques, people are willing to buy anything online. App creating ideas for buying and selling are only limited to the number of categories of goods. If you run a physical store, moving online is a good idea to grow your audience.

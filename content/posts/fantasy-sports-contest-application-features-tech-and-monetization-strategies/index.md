What Is a Fantasy Sports App?

Before we proceed to the peculiarities of fantasy sports app development, letâ€™s start with the basics.

Such an app is a digital solution that provides users with the required tools to create virtual teams made up of real-world athletes. These teams earn points based on the actual performance of players during live matches. The better your players perform on the real field, the higher your team scores within the app.

In 2024, the global fantasy sports market value was at the level of $28.95 billion. According to the latest research, by 2033, the industry size can reach $67.03 billion. This will showcase a CAGR of 9.29% for the forecast period.

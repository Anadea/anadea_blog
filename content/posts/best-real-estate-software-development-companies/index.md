questionary:
  - question: How much does it cost to develop custom real estate software?
    answer: The cost of your project will depend on its scope and complexity. Among
      other influencing factors are team size, timeline, and ongoing maintenance
      needs. Simple apps or MVPs may start in the tens of thousands of dollars.
      Meanwhile, the cost of full-scale platforms with advanced features and
      integrations will be significantly higher. It can reach $100,000 and more.
  - question: What is the difference between custom development and white-label
      solutions?
    answer: Custom development presupposes building software specifically for your
      business needs. It ensures full flexibility and ownership of the code.
      White-label solutions are prebuilt platforms that can be rebranded and
      configured based on your requirements. It’s much faster to launch them
      than to build an app from scratch, but they have limited customization and
      scalability.
  - question: When should I choose custom development over SaaS?
    answer: Custom development is the better option when your business requires
      unique workflows and a competitive product differentiator. Custom
      solutions provide great control and flexibility. At the same time, SaaS
      can be chosen for standardized processes.
  - question: Can you build AI features like property valuation or market predictions?
    answer: Yes, at Anadea, we have solid expertise in AI development. Our team can
      power your real estate software with advanced AI-driven features. For
      example, we can implement automated property valuation models, demand
      forecasting, pricing recommendations, and market trend predictions. These
      solutions rely on historical data and external market data to deliver
      actionable insights for users.

By 2032, it is expected to reach $34.1 billion. This growth demonstrates the increasing adoption of property technology and supports the demand for real estate software development services. 

In 2026, real estate businesses are actively launching new systems for their needs. Others enhance their existing solutions and equip them with advanced[ AI functionality](https://anadea.info/blog/ai-in-real-estate/), like copilots for agents and investors, analytics, computer vision tools, etc. For such projects, they often need specialized tech skills that they can access through partnerships with custom real estate software development companies.

If you search for providers of [real estate software development services](https://anadea.info/solutions/real-estate-software), you will get thousands of offers. Even though they may look quite similar, in reality, different teams can’t ensure the same quality. They all may focus on different technology stacks and types of products. This means that before choosing a partner for your next project, you need to conduct good market research.

We included only those teams that have proven delivery maturity and real estate case studies. All of them have their specific strengths that can become a decisive factor in your choice.

### Anadea

Anadea stands out for successful long-term partnerships with major players like Zillow, which proves the company’s ability to support evolving product needs. One of the examples is the [StreetEasy](https://anadea.info/projects/streeteasy) project. This collaboration started more than 12 years ago.

Zillow-owned StreetEasy is one of the most visited real estate platforms in the US. However, its aging monolithic architecture was a serious barrier to the platform’s growth. The task for Anadea was to modernize StreetEasy and adapt it to the needs of its growing audiences.

The team transitioned the platform to a microservices architecture, as well as introduced Kubernetes orchestration and real‑time monitoring. Apart from this, developers integrated advanced features like interactive maps, 3D tours, and personalized search tools. 

These updates significantly improved performance and engagement. StreetEasy achieved a 115 % increase in sales leads and now can ensure 33x faster page load times. This allows the platform to support high traffic and complex workflows, handling over 180 million annual visits annually

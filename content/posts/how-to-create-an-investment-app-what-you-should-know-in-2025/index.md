  - question: How long does it take to create an investment app?
    answer: The time needed for the software development project realization should
      be estimated individually for each particular case. It directly depends on
      the complexity of your solution, the number of required features and
      integrations, as well as the composition of the team. On average, the
      development can take from 4 to 9 months. However, for more advanced
      solutions powered by customized AI and ML models, this time can be
      increased. To get a more accurate estimation of timelines, please, contact
      your development team and share your project requirements.
  - question: How can I earn money on my investment application?
    answer: There are various options for businesses that launch such solutions. For
      example, you can take fees for each transaction or introduce AUM fees.
      Among other popular options, we should name the introduction of premium
      features or subscriptions. One more promising monetization model is ad
      placement.
  - question: How to build an investment platform that will succeed?
    answer: One of the most important things that can ensure success, apart from the
      quality and reliability of the app itself, is the idea behind it. We
      recommend you attentively study the market beforehand to identify the
      existing gaps, trends, and users’ needs. It will help you better
      understand what you can offer them. It’s crucial to detect the target
      audience and analyze the preferences and interests of this group. Another
      point on your to-do list should be an analysis of the existing investment
      apps. You need to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Based on this
      you will be able to come to a conclusion about what your app should offer
      in order to win the hearts of users.
  - question: How to find a team that will build an investment app for me?
    answer: One of the most popular ways to do it is just to use Google. However,
      here, you should be ready to see too many companies with very similar sets
      of services. Nevertheless, it’s highly unlikely that they can ensure the
      same quality of services. It means that you need to conduct thorough
      research to find out whether a team can deliver what it promises. We
      recommend you use such professional platforms as GoodFirms or Clutch.
      There you can find detailed information about different companies, as well
      as their rankings and users’ reviews. You should pay attention to teams’
      expertise in the financial domain, the technologies they work with, their
      portfolios, and terms of cooperation.

## The most popular types of online investment apps

Before finding out how to create an investing app, it’s very important to make up your mind on the type of solution that you will build. Here are some app types that boast high popularity today.

![The most popular types of online investment apps](types-of-online-investment-apps.png)

### Stock trading apps

They enable users to buy and sell stocks and ETFs (exchange trading funds). These apps are traditionally equipped with real-time market data, technical charts, and customizable watchlists. Such solutions may not be the best choice for beginners. They are mainly targeted at active traders and investors who are focused on self-directed investing.

### Robo-advisors

These tools help users automate the process of investing based on the indicated goals, risk tolerance, and timelines. Such solutions can be standalone applications or separate modules of a broader platform. They can also offer portfolio management and automatic rebalancing features. They are often chosen by beginners and passive investors who are looking for low-cost investment management.

### Cryptocurrency investment apps

These applications facilitate trading and holding of crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and others. As a rule, they have integrated crypto wallets and such features as price tracking charts, staking, and earning rewards. Though there are a lot of critics of cryptocurrency in the world of traditional finance, the general sentiments are gradually changing. The demand for such apps, as well as crypto adoption, is continuously growing. 

### Micro investing apps

Such solutions allow users to invest small amounts of money, often by rounding up purchases. They are enriched with automatic savings and investing tools, fractional shares of stocks and ETFs, as well as educational materials for beginners.

### Retirement investing applications

These tools are intended for long-term retirement investing through tax-advantaged plans, like 401(k) in the US. They offer tax-efficient portfolios and tools for financial planning.

### Educational apps for investors

You can create an investment app that will provide tools and content for learning about investing and financial markets. New investors who want to learn the basics can benefit from simulated trading, gamified quizzes, and interactive courses.

### Social investing apps

The idea of these solutions is based on integrating social networking with investing. This concept makes it easier for users to discuss market trends, share strategies, and copy trades. Apps from these groups can also be highly valuable for beginners who want to get inspired by investing skills and knowledge of more experienced users. But also they are quite popular among those who prefer collaborative investing. These applications have community forums, copy-trading options, and leaderboards for top-performing investors.

## Perks of investment app development

For those who are considering the creation of an investment application, it is vital to understand whether this project will ensure any benefits.

Here are the advantages and new opportunities such a solution can bring to both businesses and users.

### Benefits of investment app development for businesses

It happens as younger, tech-savvy generations, including millennials and Gen Z, are starting to pay more attention to the investment market.
* ***The possibility to reach a wide audience.*** Investment apps look appealing to a broad group of potential users, from beginners to experienced investors. Beginners can benefit from robo-advisors and educational tools. At the same time, traders with solid experience can leverage advanced analytics and fast execution.

For instance, fractional shares can allow users to start their investment journey with as little as $1. If you want to target your app at beginners, you should take care of creating intuitive interfaces and helpful educational content. This will simplify investing.
* ***Promotion of financial literacy.*** Many users want to learn how to manage their money effectively. And such an application can become an excellent educational tool. You can include articles, videos, or simulators, as well as real-time insights into investment performance.

Just with one click, users can get access to their transactions, performance reports, and tax documents. As a result, the use of such an app can save users’ time and effort in managing their finances.

## How to create an investment app: Brief step-by-step guide

The investment app development should be a well-structured process. Here are the main steps to include in it.

1. ***Ideation and market research.*** Identify the primary goal of the app and understand your audience. You also need to analyze the ongoing[ industry trends](https://anadea.info/blog/open-finance-vs-open-banking/), competitors, as well as identify gaps or unmet needs in the market. In other words, at this stage, you should have a clear understanding of the concept of our solution and its ability to address users’ needs.
2. ***Requirement preparation.*** You need to choose your app’s features, including those that will be built for the minimum viable product and those that will be added to the full version. Based on the desired functionality, you will be able to choose the required technologies and integrations. You can discuss the tech stack with your investment app development team.
3. ***Planning.*** Your project team should prepare a detailed roadmap with milestones and timelines. Of course, you should be ready for some flexibility. Nevertheless, the initial plan should be created to guide the team throughout the process.
4. ***Design and development.*** At this step, the team should design interfaces and build features for your app according to your requirements and the set plan. Approaches to the development can differ based on the chosen methodology.
5. ***App testing and launch.*** Before your app becomes available to users, it is vital to test its security and the correctness of its functionality. It can be done with the help of tests of different types. Some of them should be conducted in parallel with development. At the same time, it is also crucial to test the general performance of the solution after all bugs are fixed. You need to make sure that all the introduced changes haven’t caused any new issues.
6. ***Monitoring and updates.*** After the launch, your work on the app should still go on. It is very important to track its performance, timely detect and react to all possible vulnerabilities, as well as improve the existing features. We always recommend our customers attentively listen to users and try to enhance the apps based on their opinions.

## How to monetize your investment application

To achieve your goals, it’s vital to know not only how to create an investment app but also how to earn money on it. When it comes to solutions of this type, there are several monetization models that you can apply. You can choose only one of them or combine several at once. Everything depends on your key target audience and your business approach.

### Management fees

Very often online investment apps charge their users a percentage of their assets under management (AUM). For example, it can be an annual fee of the size from 0.25% to 0.50%.

### Subscription plans

You can offer tiered subscription plans that may include different sets of features. As a rule, a free tier provides only basic tools and limited functionality. At the same time, paid tiers can be equipped with various premium features, like advanced analytics, market insights, and personalized financial advice. If you choose this monetization model, please bear in mind that you need to have a very clear differentiation between free and paid tiers. Users should fully understand why it’s worth paying for upgrades.

### Transaction fees

This model presupposes that you will take a fee for each transaction made on your app. We recommend you keep transaction fees competitive and transparent to maintain user trust.

### Ads and sponsored content

You can offer brands to place ads on your application. In the case of investment platforms, it can be a good idea to cooperate mainly with financial companies that are interested in promoting their products among users of your app. If you have a section with financial advice, you can also publish sponsored posts. But regardless of the chosen approach, it is crucial to adjust ads to users’ needs and not to annoy users with excessive advertising. 

### Data monetization

As an operator of an investment application, you will get access to valuable insights into user behavior and preferences. This data can represent huge value for different third-party organizations. For example, financial institutions can use this data for market analysis or trend forecasting. However, if you want to sell this data, you should be very careful to avoid ethical or legal concerns. First of all, you need to obtain user consent for collecting any info about them. And secondly, given the existing legal norms, you can share only anonymized aggregated data.

## How much does it cost to create an investment app?

Questions about the investment app development costs are always among the most popular ones that we get from our customers. That’s absolutely natural. For businesses, it is crucial to plan their budgets beforehand. However, the issue is that it is impossible to provide an accurate answer just at once. To name realistic figures, a development team should analyze your project type, its complexity, and its peculiarities. 

Based on our experience, we can say that an MVP (minimum viable product) may cost around $20K-$30K. The cost of the development of a full-scale app usually starts at $40K. Nevertheless, the more sophisticated features your solution would include, the higher the price will be.

As a rule, to estimate project costs, development teams need to apply the following formula:

{{< advert >}}Required work hours * Hourly rate{{< /advert >}}

The complexity of solutions has a direct impact on the time needed for their creation. Here’s why some apps can turn out to be significantly more expensive than others.

Other factors that influence the project costs are related to the team that you will hire. The size of the team, its compositions, the seniority of the team members, and the location where the team is based will also affect the final amount.

We strongly recommend you discuss the financial questions with developers before making the decision regarding cooperation with them. You should understand beforehand how to allocate your budget.

## Is it always a good idea to rely on off-the-shelf solutions?

Using an off-the-shelf medication management solution can be a good idea in many cases, but it’s not always the best option. 

Of course, in comparison to medication management app development, the implementation of a ready-made solution can be a much more budget-friendly initiative. Pre-built solutions do not require upfront investments. And this always becomes the main argument in their favor. Moreover, the implementation doesn’t take long. Even if it is required to customize some features, it will be faster to deploy some changes than to build a solution from scratch. Another weighty argument in this case is that tech support and updates will be the responsibility of a vendor. This also facilitates the interaction with the solution.

However, ready-made software often has a lot of limitations that can be addressed only with custom development. Here are the most important disadvantages of off-the-shelf solutions that you should know about.

* ***Lack of customization.*** A ready-made solution may not fit your specific workflows, organizational needs, or unique patient requirements. As a result, it may be very difficult or even impossible to adapt it to some specific use cases or integrate it with other systems that you rely on.
* ***Feature gaps or overload.*** When you are considering different available solutions, that’s obvious that you are trying to find the one that will have all the required features. However, it is not always possible. Solutions on the market may either lack critical features or include some functionality that you don’t need. But at the same time, this extra functionality can complicate the usage of the solution.
* ***Full dependency on the vendor.*** You will need to rely on the vendor for updates, support, and long-term availability of the solution. On the one hand, it can be even helpful as you do not need to take responsibility for such tasks. On the other hand, you will fully depend on the vendor’s decisions. If the vendor discontinues the product, it could cease operations.
* ***Data security concerns.*** Medication management software always deals with sensitive business data. However, the fact that this data is stored on a third-party platform may raise potential security and privacy issues. Moreover, you may face difficulties in integrating such a solution with your existing internal security protocols.
* ***Scalability limitations.*** Not all available systems can meet the needs of big organizations. This could lead to a lot of tech issues like software freezing and downtimes, especially during peak loads.

If you understand that you can’t tolerate the existing limitations, the best solution for you will be to build custom medication management software. Only in this case, you can be sure that your solution will fully correspond to your requirements.

## When should you consider custom development?

* You have unique requirements that can’t be met by any of the off-the-shelf options.
* You need to integrate your new solution with proprietary or legacy systems.
* You want to have complete control over data storage, security, and compliance.

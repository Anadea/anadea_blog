But the integration of your app with popular platforms is not the only possible way to succeed. In this article, we invite you to explore how to make a social media app that will stand out in a crowded market.

## New Social Media App: Everything Starts with an Idea	

Before writing code for your future app, you need a well-formulated goal for your project. Start by asking yourself the following questions.

**What type of app will I build?**

These are the most common types of social media apps:

* Messaging apps (like WhatsApp or Telegram)
* Community-driven platforms (like Reddit or Discord)
* Content-sharing apps (like Instagram or TikTok)
* Dating apps (like Tinder or Bumble)
* Interest-based networks for niche audiences (like Strava for athletes and sport lovers, or Fishbrain for anglers)

**Who is my target audience?**

You can target either a wide or a niche audience. While some apps are created for people with different interests, you may decide to create a solution for a narrower group. For example, it can be a social app for pet owners or music lovers.

**What specific need do I want to address?**

First of all, you should study the interests of your target audience and define the existing gaps. Probably, they may need a convenient platform for idea-sharing, or they may need a reliable solution for connecting and finding support. The purposes behind your product will also help you define the set of features that you should build.

**What will encourage users to choose my app over existing ones?**

The answer to this question will have a direct impact on how you will market your app. For example, you can focus on creating some advanced functionality and promote your solution based on it. Or you can position your application as a unique online space for a specific social group.

### Successful Niche Apps

One of the greatest examples is Strava. It is designed for athletes, with a primary focus on running, cycling, and swimming. The app enables its users to record and analyze their workouts, connect with others, share progress, and compete on specific routes with others. Today, it has [over 150 million users from 185+ countries](https://press.strava.com/about).

Another example is Fishbrain. It is built specifically for anglers. The solution offers tools to improve and personalize the fishing experience. With its help, users can discover new fishing spots, identify species, and stay updated on local fishing regulations. It unites [over 15 million anglers](https://careers.fishbrain.com/), which makes it the number 1 app for fishing lovers.

questionary:
  - question: How is big data transforming the learning experience?
    answer: Big data-powered systems enable personalized learning. They can analyze
      students’ progress and adapt content to individual needs. Apart from that,
      they can also identify at-risk learners early, help them reduce learning
      gaps, and improve engagement through real-time feedback.
  - question: Does the use of big data in higher education differ from its use in K–12?
    answer: Yes, the purposes of using this technology in different educational
      institutions are different. In K–12, focus is mainly on student behavior
      tracking, attendance, and standardized test preparation. Meanwhile, big
      data analytics in higher education is used to optimize course offerings,
      predict dropout risks, track academic progression, and improve
      institutional efficiency.
  - question: Why is big data adoption usually faster in higher education than in K–12?
    answer: Big data and higher education are more closely linked thanks to the
      greater autonomy and typically larger IT budgets that universities and
      colleges possess. This allows them to deploy data-driven tools more
      quickly. K–12 schools are typically more centralized, and their budgets
      can be seriously restricted.

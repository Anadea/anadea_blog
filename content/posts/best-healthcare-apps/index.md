Scientists in medicine synthesize organs and tissues, create realistic prosthetic devices, and make other things thought fantastic real. Impressive it is, but how is technology advancement applied in more routine healthcare operations? It is applied in a way, more precisely – in <a href="https://anadea.info/solutions/medical-app-development" target="_blank">medical app development</a>. But before going further, one issue has to be clarified.

## Health apps vs. Healthcare apps: what’s the difference?
To avoid confusion, it is important to distinguish between apps for self-care, like fitness apps, calorie counters, and sleep trackers with healthcare apps for patient care.

Apps falling under the first category, __health apps__, help users better understand how their body works, track their habits, and maintain a healthier lifestyle.

Meanwhile, __healthcare apps__ are used in applied medical practice or for tracking particular medical conditions. That’s why an alternative way to name healthcare apps is __medical apps__.

To explain the difference more clearly, imagine that health apps are vitamins and healthcare, or medical apps, are prescription medications.

## The great benefits of healthcare apps
Let’s be brutally honest here: are apps essential for life? Somehow, our ancestors used to make it without mobile devices at all. Apps are a great business and an amazing tool to simplify lives, but definitely not save them.

Well, it is a bit different with health care apps. Saying they save lives are big words, but with no exaggeration, they can contribute to a more efficient patient treatment.

Medical apps enable faster and more quality patient communication with healthcare practitioners. Doctors can store and input information about patients in one place and share it with other doctors immediately. And one not so evident benefit of apps in healthcare is that they bring some extra profit to doctors.

Sounds great yet not quite specific, and to improve this, we prepared a list of the best healthcare apps for your knowledge and inspiration.

## Best medical apps in the market
Today, practically any condition can be managed or at least controlled. Let’s see how mobile healthcare apps are assisting with it.

__Why these apps?__ When making this list, we had a goal to showcase that the healthcare app industry is not limited to the standard on-demand consultations concept. Such apps are for sure present in the list but just as well as health care apps for specific conditions: diabetes, eye diseases, acne. Maybe you come up with something unique after looking through these examples.

## Final thoughts
The biggest achievement of medical apps for patients is its direct impact on people's well-being. A doctor visit that used to require allocating a few hours now can take much shorter time.

Still, users have to acknowledge that for some conditions even the top healthcare apps are not enough. Apps won’t make it with emergency cases and when intervention is needed.

So it is critical that medical apps promote in-person visits to a doctor as much as they promote themselves. Only this way, a perfect balance will be reached that will allow people to use their time with maximum efficiency and not miss a single health condition.
